        <h2>What is a Paladin?</h2> 
         <!-- I would die if I dont include *the meme* here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thuh3dnCrkU / Okay I swear that I will resist the temptation to include more memes ;)  -->
        
        <p id="whatis"> <em>In the medieval chanson de geste cycle of the Matter of France, the paladins or Twelve Peers are the twelve foremost knights of Charlemagne's court, comparable to the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian romance. They represent the valour of Christian chivalry against the Saracen invasion of Europe. Their most notable appearance is in The Song of Roland, narrating the heroic death of Roland at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.</em> <br> 
          
         Paladins are virtuous defenders of the weak, and tireless, unfaltering enemies of the undead. Mixing elements of the warrior and the clerics of the Holy Light, the paladin is a tough melee fighter. </p>

<p>The paladin is a "warrior of the Holy Light". They uphold all that is good and true in the world and revile all that is evil and sinister, especially undead and the Burning Legion. They offer succor to the beleaguered and smite their enemies with holy fervor. They are particularly potent against undead, as these creatures threaten the goodly races and the Holy Light burns them terribly. The presence of any evil is reprehensible to paladins, but they focus their efforts on destroying undead and demons. </p>

<p>These warriors uphold the tenets of the Holy Light and defend their factions from the predations of any threat. Found in almost every corner of Azeroth fighting the forces of evil and barbarism, these stalwart warriors of faith ceaselessly uphold their vigil against demonic forces from beyond the Dark Portal. Paladins are the embodiment of good and selfless dedication to the protection of their peoples. They help the innocent and punish the wicked. As such, paladins are generally of good alignment.</p>

        <h2>In World of Warcraft</h2>
        <p>Silvermoon, like most of Quel'Thalas, borrows heavily from the Art Nouveau style. Its extravagances are copious and the city blends the natural and the magical together, with many open plots of grass and trees (many of which are styled, presumably magically, in impossible ways) around the city. Silvermoon has many statues within its walls, the most common depicting Kael'thas Sunstrider and a regal female of unknown identity. Others depict hooded female rangers and poised magistrixes. <em>The city favours golds, whites, and reds, as it did 7,000 years ago.</em></p>

<p>Silvermoon's banner is a gold phoenix on a red background. Many variations of this exist.</p>

<p>The city's appearance could be seen as reflective of the blood elves' own psyche. The blood elves are trapped in a struggle with their hunger for magic, caught between mastering this desire or letting it master them, and the duality of Silvermoon reflects their inner struggle. One side ruined, one side restored to its former glory; magnificent on the outside, lingering darkness on the inside. However, the truly interesting insights reveal themselves when players look closer at what is going on in Silvermoon City. Beyond the luscious avenues, behind the rich billowing curtains, lie dark and gloomy interiors, and those who explore the other side of Silvermoon City may find that the city's beautiful facade serves only to hide the true, more-sinister side of the city.</p>

Their resolute conviction in the divine order of all things assures them that victory is inevitable—but they will fight to the end to ensure that the Light prevails.</em></p>
