        <h2>What is a Paladin?</h2>
        
        <p>The crown jewel of the blood elves is their capital of <strong>Silvermoon City</strong> (aka Silvermoon), nestled in the Eversong Woods in their ancestral lands of Quel'Thalas. At the northernmost tip of the Eastern Kingdoms the beauty of the spires and thoroughfares of Silvermoon stand in stark contrast to the Dead Scar, the tainted path that Arthas tore through the city in his quest for power. Though nearly destroyed by Arthas' attack on the Sunwell, Silvermoon is once again a thriving city. Most recently, the rebirth of the Sunwell has lifted spirits among the elves, and they have continued to heal Silvermoon's scars in the hopes of returning their beloved capital to its former glory, the western half of it still being in ruins since the Third War. </p>
        
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Silvermoon, like most of Quel'Thalas, borrows heavily from the Art Nouveau style. Its extravagances are copious and the city blends the natural and the magical together, with many open plots of grass and trees (many of which are styled, presumably magically, in impossible ways) around the city. Silvermoon has many statues within its walls, the most common depicting Kael'thas Sunstrider and a regal female of unknown identity. Others depict hooded female rangers and poised magistrixes. <em>The city favours golds, whites, and reds, as it did 7,000 years ago.</em></p>

<p>Silvermoon's banner is a gold phoenix on a red background. Many variations of this exist.</p>

<p>The city's appearance could be seen as reflective of the blood elves' own psyche. The blood elves are trapped in a struggle with their hunger for magic, caught between mastering this desire or letting it master them, and the duality of Silvermoon reflects their inner struggle. One side ruined, one side restored to its former glory; magnificent on the outside, lingering darkness on the inside. However, the truly interesting insights reveal themselves when players look closer at what is going on in Silvermoon City. Beyond the luscious avenues, behind the rich billowing curtains, lie dark and gloomy interiors, and those who explore the other side of Silvermoon City may find that the city's beautiful facade serves only to hide the true, more-sinister side of the city.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The inhabited half of the city is arranged into separate but linked areas that each carry a unique feel.</p>


    
 <h3 id="shepardsgate">The Shepherd's Gate</h3>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Car_bed_kap2.jpg/600px-Car_bed_kap2.jpg" alt="some gate" width="250">
 
 
 
    <p>The Shepherd's Gate is the main (and only) conventional entrance to Silvermoon, decorated by a towering statue depicting the likeness of Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider. An equally large entrance paves way to the western half of Silvermoon, though this leads only to the town of Falconwing Square; the western portion of the city itself having yet to be reclaimed. The Shepherd's Gate overlooks much of Quel'Thalas, with colourful gardens to its front and a bulk of blood elven guards to its back.

Though the Shepherd's Gate holds the distinction of being the only practical entrance to Silvermoon, two others are still in existence: the Orb of Translocation at the back of the royal palace, which offers a teleport to the Ruins of Lordaeron, and a massive gate to the west of the Bazaar. However, said gate is closed and guarded, presumably due to the drawbacks a back entrance could prove, and the fact that the blood elves' control of western Silvermoon is perhaps not yet strong enough to warrant another gate to match the Shepherd's. </p>

<h3 id="walkofelders">Walk of Elders</h3>
    <p>The Walk of Elders offers the first glimpse to the blood elves' beauteous capital. Magical ornaments adorn the streets, while the autumn-touched trees found within Quel'Thalas grow here, too, albeit on a smaller scale, and clash neatly with the rest of the city and its red, gold, and autumn-bathed complexion. It is also perhaps the first sighting of the Arcane Guardians; at least, ones under proper control and not prone to malfunction. The hulking robotic constructs will urge the citizens of Silvermoon to remain law-abiding and encourage happiness in addition to singing praises for Silvermoon's leader, the regent of Quel'Thalas: Lor'themar Theron.</p>
    
    <p>Rows of benches shrouded in crimson curtains are slashed across the Walk of Elders, perfect for a moment of respite. The Walk of Elders is also the central point of the city, connecting its neighbors to the east, north and west. It houses several profession trainers, and offers a back entrance to a magisters' lounge named the Mana Loom in the eastern court of The Royal Exchange. Also of note is the presence of the sin'dorei's Horde allies in the Walk of Elders; Harene Plainwalker on hand for druid training and Gez'li for shamans, just north of Velaani's Arcane Goods. The celebrated Tauren Chieftains are currently within the blood elven capital too, resting in a spire just east of the Walk's entrance and right of the Silvermoon Registry.</p>
 
 <h3 id="thebazaar">The Bazaar</h3> 
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Grand-Bazaar_Shop.jpg/800px-Grand-Bazaar_Shop.jpg" alt="some bazaar" width="250">
    
    <p>The Bazaar is the primary trading area of the city, housing one of its two sets of auction houses along with all of the other practical essentials any sin'dorei could need: an armoury, a weapons' barracks, a bank and a collection of other useful services among them. The Bazaar also houses one of the several inns around the city, named Wayfarer's Rest (a popular spot for roleplaying), with enough elaborately-conjured and appetizing food and drink to sate one's hunger and thirst for as long as need be.</p>

<p>Outside, a colossal fountain neatly nestles itself in the center of the Bazaar, while a gathered crowd on the far-western zone tends to two dissidents, whose anti-magisters rhetoric takes a conspicuous change in tone after one such magister casts a spell on the pair. Conjurer Tyren also begins his rounds in the Bazaar, lighting up the sky with several magical indulgences.</p>

<p>Also of wry amusement in the Bazaar is the Keelen's Trustworthy Tailoring shop, whose neat work appears to be a dubiously kind front after visiting the leper gnomes employed beneath its main lounge. Silvermoon Finery is on hand for any cloth-related needs a sin'dorei may have.</p>
